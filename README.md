Application was developed using Laravel 7. Your local machine needs to have PHP and composer installed. I use XAMPP as a cross-platform web server stack package. Composer can be installed from https://getcomposer.org/

1. Clone the repo to your local
2. Go onto the terminal, and cd into the project folder. 
3. To run the application, run the command on the terminal 'php artisan serve' and it will display a local url to view on the browser
